# odin-dust-examples
A collection of models that can be implemented, simulated and fitted using odin, dust and mcstate. 

I implemented a stochastic SIR model, as an example of transmission models. This can be easily 
extended to more complex epidemiological compartments models.

Then, I implemented a Lotka-Volterra model for 2, 3 and for n>=2 species.
The LotkaVolterra.R file contains the classical predator prey model.
The LotkaVolterraComp2.R contains the competition model for 2 species.
The files containing the competition models for 3 and n>=2 species are named analogously.

I also implemented a Wright-Fisher model. It describes the selection pressures that affect Streptococcus pneumoniae strains which are influenced by vaccination of the human host.
