# odin-dust-examples
A collection of models that can be implemented, simulated and fitted using odin, dust and mcstate.

This is a collection of models that shows for which kinds of projects the odin/dust and mcstate 
suite can be used. 

I implemented a stochastic SIR model, as an example of transmission models. This can be easily 
extended to more complex epidemiological compartments models.

And then there is a Lotka-Volterra model for 2, 3 and for n>=2 species.
The LotkaVolterra.R file contains the classical predator prey model.
The LotkaVolterraComp2.R contains the competition model for 2 species.
The files containing the competition models for 3 and n>=2 species are named analogously.

Lastly, I implemented (/will implement) a population genetics model, more specifically a 
Fisher-Wright model.
